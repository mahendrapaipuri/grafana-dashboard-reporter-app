      # If operators want to generate reports programatically using API requests with 
      # clients like, say `curl`, using service account tokens it is necessary to configure
      # that **same** service account token in the plugin's config.
      #
      # Grafana will use this token to make API requests to Grafana
      # to fetch dashboards and panels. The token must have appropriate permissions
      # and roles to be able to generate reports.
      #
      # This token can be configured from the Grafana UI as well.
      #
      # In Grafana >= 10.3.0, by enabling `externalServiceAccounts` feature flag, this

      # requests will be made to this URL. For most of the deployments the default value 
      # will work.

      # If the Grafana is configured to use cookie_samesite "strict", the default localhost:3000
